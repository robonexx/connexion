## Vite + React + TypeScript + Tailwind + React-router-dom + framer-motion + Vercel


# DC APP - EXAM

### [Link to the website.](https://dev-dcapp.vercel.app)

On the page you can sign up for now, will be removed
to try out all passwords for now is test123

```sh
name        password    role
---------------------------------
rupert      test123     admin
student1    test123     student
teach1      test123     teacher
```


 should be able to enter all pages

```sh
Role            access                                      No access
admin           all                             
student         /   /students   /posts      /posts/add      /dashboard  /teachers   
teacher         /   /teachers   /posts      /posts/add      /dashboard  /students

```

```sh
everyone 
/login 
/signup

```

```sh
unauthenticated no access to 
/home 
/dashboard
/students
/teachers

```

```sh
admin 
- should be able to add user and update them also delete the users in the dashboard

```

Everyone can access to see and create posts / the security is not setup yet
- it will error out on creating post, due to no auth or id available in post creation



### thats about it for now 
- more to be added, 
- pages for differetn classes, 
- notes page, 
- setting and profile for each user to be entered with their own content and info



Focus was on creating a prototype and to learn role based authentication
This project will continue and be released in august of 2024 as a communication app 

## Tech used in this project

-   NEXT 14
-   TAILWIND
-   TYPESCRIPT
-   MONGO DB
-   NEXT-AUTH



## What I Learned?

Started to learn auth, how to secure routes and make them role based
Next-Auth login and singup
Server actions
More Tailwind
New functions while working on this project
I done some new functions to be used in mongo db like checking year, checking passwords

I converted images to base64 saving on mongo db as a string ( which im using)
I tried out Cloudinary form image storage
Firebase and Uploathing for image storage ðŸ¥³ 

Server side vs Client side pros and cons

## Purpose
Purpose is to build and communication app so that the school dont have to use fb groups and has full control over the content

## Features
Features will include, login, admin being able to add, update delete students and teachers
Post to share on different channels, 
Post crud is done, but not the channels
Notes to be kept for each user by them selfs - doing at the moment
Comment and likes on posts - not done yet

## Future features
Notifications
Direct messaging
Attendance
Better auth security and more deep dive to next auth

## Api routes vs server functions
For scalability i think api routes still servers its purpose, and having the server separete is probable a better choice
I like server actions and will definitly use them more in projects
Server functions are easier and takes less time to get going with

## DB
Firebase vs Mongodb vs Supabase
I like em all!
